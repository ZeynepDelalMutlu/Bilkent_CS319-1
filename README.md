**Project:**

Our project is a replica of the game "Curve Fever 2". It will be a Java Desktop Application. 

The link of the game: [Curve Fever 2](http://forum.curvefever.com/play2.php)

Curve Fever 2 is a game which can be played at least 2 people. Though it can be played either in the same computer or based on network
in our application we will focus on playing on the same computer. In this game, each player is given a distinct color randomly and 
allowed changes in the color. When the game starts, the colors to move by their head and leave a pattern behind themselves while giving
some gaps. The objective of the game is not the cross each others color. The players are allowed to move their color, either left or right.
During gameplay, there pops some popups in the screen which can either give player a boost or harden the gameplay for his/her.
